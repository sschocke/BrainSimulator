# Welcome to Brain Simulator documentation

The Brain Simulator project is a framework/library/application for effective development/testing of our neural models. It will allow you to:

* Implement your specific model/algorithm as a node that can be used in a larger architecture
* Simulate its behaviour in various environments (called worlds, which provide data sources and outputs/actuators)
* Combine it with algorithms and tools created by others
* Tune your algorithm parameters effectively
* Visualize your data (inputs, outputs, inner memory) with various rendering options
* Implement your own visualizers (called observers) and worlds if needed
* Create projects with complex architectures, save, load and export their states

## Content of this documentation:

* [UI](ui.md) - UI description
* [Model](model.md) - how to implement your own model
* [Observer](observer.md) - how to implement your own observer
* **Guides** - various guides
* [Changelog](changelog.md) - changelog and list of future ideas
* [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ghhVl_UJwk) - short video tutorial on building a simple neural network

## Examples
Examples can be found in the **Examples** section. If you use the official Brain Simulator installer, you can also find the examples in the installation folder (typically *c:\Program Files\GoodAI\Brain Simulator*).
