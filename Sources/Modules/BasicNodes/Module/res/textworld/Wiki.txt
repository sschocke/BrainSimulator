At GoodAI, we are trying to build artificial brains that can learn, be creative, and adapt to the environment in the way a human does. 
Our brains will respond to what they perceive, and will interact with their environment to achieve goals defined by human mentors.
Our mission is to develop general artificial intelligence, be helpful to humanity, and understand the universe.
